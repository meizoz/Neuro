Project of neurons simulation

Compile with SimuNeur.cpp as main for the full simulation
(Simu1Neur.cpp and Simu2Neur.cpp used for previous testing)

spikes.png is a graph (generated by gnuplot) from the results of the program in case C (G=5,ETA=2), x axis is time (in ms), y axis is the number of spikes.


Plots on Fig8 are generated by script.py, from the data of spikes.txt(result of simulation) with different parameters :
A : G=3, ETA=2
B : G=6, ETA=4
C : G=5, ETA=2
D : G=4.5, ETA=0.9
